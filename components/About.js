      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a motivated and detail-oriented Software Engineer with a strong
        foundation in full stack web development and a deep interest in building
        scalable, high-quality digital products. I am currently pursuing a
        Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, where I have developed
        a solid understanding of software engineering principles, data
        structures, and modern web technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am presently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Gyanyug RIG
        Innovation, where I contribute to real-world applications, collaborate
        with experienced professionals, and gain hands-on exposure to
        production-level development practices. This experience has enhanced my
        problem-solving abilities, code quality awareness, and understanding of
        end-to-end application development.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my technical background, I have a strong analytical
        mindset, supported by my active involvement in stock trading. This has
        strengthened my ability to analyze data, assess risk, and make informed
        decisions—skills that translate effectively into software development
        and system design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am passionate about continuous learning, writing clean and maintainable
        code, and staying aligned with evolving technologies. I am seeking
        opportunities where I can add value, grow as a professional engineer,
        and contribute to impactful and innovative software solutions.
