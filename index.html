    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="slide active">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Information Technology undergraduate with a strong focus on building reliable,
        scalable, and maintainable software systems. My interests lie in full-stack development,
        backend architecture, and problem-solving driven by real-world constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        I approach software engineering with a systems mindset — understanding how components
        interact, how systems scale, and how failures are handled. I value clean architecture,
        clarity in code, and long-term maintainability over short-term solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continuously refine my skills by working on practical projects, learning modern
        development practices, and contributing to production-grade systems.
      </p>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe great engineering is silent, reliable, and intentional.
        Every line of code should serve a purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        I prioritize simplicity over unnecessary complexity, maintainability over clever
        shortcuts, and predictable behavior over fragile features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good software should be easy to reason about, resilient under pressure,
        and adaptable to change.

    <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p><strong>Software Engineer</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Gyanyug RIG Innovation</strong></p>
      <p>
        I currently work as a Software Engineer at Gyanyug RIG Innovation, where I contribute
        to the development of real-world, production-grade software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My responsibilities include designing and implementing scalable backend logic,
        working with full-stack architectures, optimizing performance and reliability,
        and writing clean, maintainable, and secure code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This role has strengthened my understanding of how software behaves in real
        environments, where performance, stability, and clarity matter more than experimentation.
